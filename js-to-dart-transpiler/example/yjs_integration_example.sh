# Script to demonstrate transpiling Y.js source files to Dart
# This would be used to transpile actual Y.js repository files

echo "JavaScript to Dart Transpiler - Y.js Integration Example"
echo "======================================================="

echo ""
echo "1. This would typically transpile core Y.js files:"
echo "   - yjs/src/structs/YText.js → YText.dart" 
echo "   - yjs/src/structs/YMap.js → YMap.dart"
echo "   - yjs/src/structs/YArray.js → YArray.dart"
echo "   - yjs/src/utils/* → utils/*.dart"

echo ""
echo "2. Example command to transpile Y.js YText:"
echo "   dart run bin/transpiler.dart -i yjs/src/structs/YText.js -o lib/y_text.dart"

echo ""
echo "3. After transpilation, you would need to manually implement:"
echo "   - Node.js crypto functions → Dart crypto package"
echo "   - EventEmitter → Dart Stream/StreamController" 
echo "   - Buffer operations → Dart Uint8List"
echo "   - File system operations → Dart dart:io"

echo ""
echo "4. The resulting Dart code would preserve:"
echo "   ✅ YATA algorithm logic"
echo "   ✅ CRDT conflict resolution"  
echo "   ✅ Data structure implementations"
echo "   ✅ Core business logic"

echo ""
echo "5. Benefits of this approach:"
echo "   • Leverage mature Y.js algorithms directly"
echo "   • Reduce implementation time from months to weeks"
echo "   • Maintain compatibility with Y.js protocol"
echo "   • Get automatic updates when Y.js improves"

echo ""
echo "To use with real Y.js source:"
echo "1. Clone Y.js: git clone https://github.com/yjs/yjs.git"
echo "2. Run transpiler on each core file"
echo "3. Implement placeholder functions for your target platform"
echo "4. Test and refine the generated Dart code"
