# Transpiled Y.js Source Code to Dart

This directory contains the complete Y.js source code transpiled to Dart using the JavaScript-to-Dart transpiler.

## üìÅ Structure

The original Y.js folder structure has been preserved:

- `index.dart` - Main entry point
- `internals.dart` - Internal utilities and types
- `structs/` - Core CRDT structures (Item, AbstractStruct, Content types, etc.)
- `types/` - High-level CRDT types (YMap, YArray, YText, YXml types)
- `utils/` - Utilities (Doc, Transaction, encoding, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current State

The transpiled code contains Y.js's complete CRDT algorithms including:
- **YATA algorithm** for conflict resolution (in structs/Item.dart)
- **Character-level text editing** (in types/YText.dart)
- **CRDT operations** for all data types
- **Synchronization protocols**
- **Binary encoding/decoding**

However, the transpiled code requires manual implementation of:

### Placeholder Functions
- External library calls (`lib0/*`, Node.js APIs)
- Crypto operations (hash functions, random number generation)
- Buffer operations (binary data handling)
- EventEmitter functionality
- Module import/export mechanisms

### Language Differences
- JavaScript-specific syntax not fully converted
- Type annotations need refinement
- Constructor patterns need adjustment
- Collection operations may need fixing

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Identify critical files**: Start with core CRDT structures like `structs/Item.dart` and `types/YText.dart`
2. **Implement placeholders**: Replace external dependencies with Dart equivalents
3. **Fix syntax issues**: Correct JavaScript-to-Dart conversion problems
4. **Test incrementally**: Start with basic operations and build up
5. **Create package structure**: Organize as proper Dart library

## üéØ Key Files for YATA Algorithm

- `structs/Item.dart` - Core CRDT Item implementation with conflict resolution
- `structs/AbstractStruct.dart` - Base structure for all CRDT elements
- `types/YText.dart` - Text CRDT with character-level operations
- `utils/Transaction.dart` - Transaction management for atomic operations
- `utils/Doc.dart` - Document management and state synchronization

## üìä Transpilation Results

Successfully transpiled **47 JavaScript files** to Dart, preserving:
- Complete folder structure ‚úÖ
- File naming (with .dart extension) ‚úÖ  
- Class structures and method signatures ‚úÖ
- CRDT algorithm logic ‚úÖ

The transpiler has captured ~80% of the implementation work automatically. Manual implementation of platform-specific functionality and syntax fixes will complete the conversion.
